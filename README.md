# Steve

This is the main repository for Steve, a fake Docker clone that I'm making as part of an ongoing series on [my YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCBSRCuGz9laxVv0rAnn2O9Q).

All development and design of this project is going to be recorded and published on YT,
with a schedule planned to be every week or two.

## Community implementations

These are the projects of my viewers who are following along (the ones I've found) - if you want yours added, send a PR! :)
